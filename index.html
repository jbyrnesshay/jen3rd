					<h2> Trip to Tibet Introduction</h2>
					<!-- this div styles the intro content in left content into 3 columns completely contained within the left column -->
					<div id="columncount">
						<p> In January 2016, I went solo on a 3-day trip to <a href="https://www.travelchinaguide.com/cityguides/tibet/lhasa/">Lhasa, Tibet</a>.  Tibet is a place I had always had a fascination with and wanted to visit since I was a child.  </p>
						<p>It’s definitely worth more than a 3 day trip, but my available time was short and I didn’t want to let that stop me.</p>
						<p>  The distance from my town of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to Lhasa, Tibet is 7,556 miles.  I wasn't going to let that stop me either.</p>
 						<p>Lhasa is actually only the 2nd most distant place I've been to.  I've also been to <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/nepal/kathmandu">Kathmandu, Nepal</a>, which is further (7629 miles), on another trip. That's a long way, but its stil less than 1/3 of the way completely around the world. </p>
						<p>  Lhasa is the site of a number of historic <a href="itinerary.html#temples">monasteries and temples</a>.  It's one of the few large cities in Tibet but it's a small city by American standards.  It's more equivalent to a large town.</p>
						<p>To travel there is not an easy trip.  From my town of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the quickest you can do the trip to Lhasa is in about 30 hours of travel (one-way).  There are no direct flights fromthe United States. </p>
						<p>As you might imagine, it's also a very expensive trip (more than I really should be splurging on).</p>
 						<p> I expected Lhasa to have retained more of the traditional Tibetan vibe that I had my head, the exotic image that had played in my head for years.  So, at first I was a little disillusioned by all of the modernization and development. </p> <p>However, it still has historical sites and 
 						old-town areas such as  <a href="itinerary.html#bharkor">Barkhor Square</a> that were similar to what I dreamed of.  The trip was challenging for a solo traveller and it wasn't everything I had hoped, but for me it was a must-do.  I'm glad I went.</p>

		 			<h2>What was my trip to Tibet like?</h2>
	     			<section>
						<h3>weather</h3>
						<p>Like in Pittsburgh, in <a href="http://www.chinahighlights.com/lhasa/weather/january.htm">January in Lhasa</a> it was winter too, so it was fairly cold, though not that much colder during the day.  There wasn’t any snow.  I packed light, and didn’t bring a heavy jacket, so I was pretty cold.  The high daily temperature was about 35-40 degrees Fahrenheit, but it was much colder early in the morning and late at night.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>People</h3>
						<p>The people were a mix of ethnic Tibetans and Chinese.  I didn’t get to observe the people much other than to just see them going about their daily business  There were many Chinese police around to keep watch on everything.  It was not the tourist season, so I was one of the few Westerners around.  It coincided with pilgrimage, so there will pilgrims from far away.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3> the sights </h3>
						<p>Chinese culture is definitely modernizing Lhasa, and the main strips have a small city feel, though there are not any very tall buildings.  It was therefore not overall the image I had in mind of it, which was an image or a less modern society.  There are a few older historical parts of Lhasa that preserve more of the old-fashioned traditional feel.  The monasteries and temples are mostly either museums now, or are have parts that are active but are also  museums or tourist sites at the same time.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>The food</h3>
						<p>A very popular food are <dfn><a href="http://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/the-story-of-momos-what-makes-this-tibetan-dumpling-so-popular-1397480">momos</a></dfn>, a type of dumpling, often filled with meat.  The ones I had were filled with yak meat.  The noodle soup I had for breakfast also included yak meat.  Yak meat is very prevalent.  It is the most popular meat, kind of the equivalent of beef, but without the competition that beef has in the United States.  Tibetans are very reliant upon it.  Another traditional breakfast is barley porridge, which I gave a pass. There were some dishes available with vegetables including potatoes, but i was left with the impression that noodles, dumplings, soup, and yak were the main staples.  Unfortunately, time was short and on this trip I didn’t have any butter tea ... a preparation of tea which is made with, you guessed it, yak butter.
