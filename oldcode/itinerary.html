          <h2 > Itinerary</h2>
          <h3 id="bharkor"> Bharkor St </h3>
          Bharkor Square is an old section of Lhasa, which preserves a more traditional village feel, with various traditional markets, shops, and restaurants.  As the site of Jokhang Temple, it is also important to pilgrams and to residents who come for religious practicies on a daily basis.
          <h3 id="temples"> Temples, Monasteries, and Palace</h3>
          <p>Lhasa still has a number of prominent historical temples and sites. 4 of these constituted the bulk of my itinerary.</p>
          <h4>Jokhang Temple</h4>
          <p> located in the Old Town area of Lhasa, encircled by Barkhor Street.</p>
          <h4>Potala Palace</h4>
          <p> A huge palace.  Now a museum.</p>
          <h4>Drepung Monastery</h4>
          <p> In my view, this was the the place with the most monastic setting, though not far at all from the other sites</p>
          <h4>Sera Monastery</h4>
          <p>Known for its "monk debates", where the monks gather in the courtyard and engage in philosophical debates which are marked by a set of rituals and formal gestures such as "hand clapping" (the monks slap their hands forecefully while making their points).

        <h3> Some pictures so you can see too </h3>

        <h4>I saw a yak </h4><p>wandering free on the grounds of the Sera Monastery.  I don't know where it was going or where it was coming from.</p>  
        <!-- this div is to group image with p tag with copywrite info, all photographs taken by me-->

        <p>
        Quite likely, it belonged to the monks. It was not my first yak, but definitely my first yak sighting at a monastery. This is one of about 10 pictures I took of it.

        <h4>The monk debates at Sera Monastery</h4> 
        <p>are a unique experience. This is not the place to explain a lot about what is going on with it, but here is one of the photos I took. </p>
        <div>
        <img src="images/sera_monks.png" alt="monks debating on sera monastery grounds">

        </div>
        <p>The standing monk in the foreground is debating with the seated monk, and his posture reflects that he is winding up to clap his hands forecefully, in one of the debating rituals the monks are known for.</p>

        <h2>surprising?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Its easy to find spaghetti, pizza, and burgers in Lhasa.   </li>
          <li> Lhasa time difference:  12 hours ahead of E.S.T. </li>
          <li> In most of Tibet, it is against the law for a traveller to go anywhere unaaccompanied by a tour guide</li>
          <li>Outside of old town district, Lhasa's main streets have a small city feel</li>
        </ul>
